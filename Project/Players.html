                <h1><u>LIONEL MESSI</u></h1><br><br>
                <p>Messi claimed the Ballon d'Or as the world's best soccer player for a record seventh time in 2021,
                    putting him two ahead of his rival Cristiano Ronaldo.
                    He transferred to Paris Saint-Germain from FC Barcelona in August 2021, leaving the only
                    professional home he had ever known.
                    A contract leak in January 2021 showed Messi was making much more at Barcelona than previously
                    thought; he was able to earn up to $165 million annually in salary and incentives.
                    In March 2022, he signed an endorsement deal with fan engagement app Socios that is set to pay him
                    $20 million annually.
                    He launched his own clothing line and opened his first retail outlet, the Messi Store, in 2019 in
                    Barcelona. He also has a lifelong deal with Adidas</p>

                <h1><u>CHRISTIANO RONALDO</u></h1><br><br>
                <p>In February 2021, Ronaldo became the first person in the world to reach 500 million followers across
                    Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. As of May 2022, he had 690 million.
                    In March 2021, he passed Brazilian legend Pele's goal tally; a hat trick against Serie A foe
                    Cagliari pushed him up to 770 goals in all competitions.
                    He switched teams in August 2021, moving from Juventus to Manchester United, where he previously
                    played from 2003 to 2009.
                    Ronaldo, a five-time FIFA player of the year, in 2020 became the first active team-sport athlete to
                    surpass $1 billion in career earnings.
                    In addition to a lifetime deal with Nike, Ronaldo makes money off the pitch with his CR7-branded
                    clothing, accessories, hotels and gyms.

                <h1><u>NEYMAR DA SILVA SANTOS JUNIOR</u></h1><br><br>
                <p>Neymar da Silva Santos Junior is a professional Brazilian footballer, who plays as a forward for the
                    national team and French club Paris Saint Germain. Commonly known as Neymar, he was born on 5
                    February 1992 in Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil. Neymar is regarded as one of the best players of his
                    generation.
                    The versatile attacker is dominant on the left wing but can play on the right wing and as a striker
                    or second striker as well. The Brazilian has 202 club goals from 346 appearances and 53 goals from
                    83 international caps.</p>

                <h1><u>KYLIAN MBAPPE</u></h1><br><br>
                <p>At just 23, Mbappe has become the face of French soccer, collecting two Ligue 1 Player of the Year
                    Awards
                    and leading the league in scoring three times in three years, while setting himself up for a fourth
                    goals title in 2021-22.
                    He is partnered with brands including Nike and Hublot. In 2020, EA Sports picked him for the cover
                    of
                    "FIFA 21," making him one of the youngest ever to grace that brand's cover solo.
                    In 2021, he released "Je m'appelle Kylian," a graphic novel aimed at inspiring kids to chase their
                    dreams.
                    In 2018, at age 19, Mbappe became the second-youngest player (after Pele) to score in a World Cup
                    final.
